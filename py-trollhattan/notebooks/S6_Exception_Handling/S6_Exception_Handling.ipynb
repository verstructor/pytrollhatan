    "- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when the second operand of a division operation is zero.\n",
    "- `TypeError`: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "- `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate value.\n",
    "- `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when attempting to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.\n",
    "- `KeyError`: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "- `RuntimeError`: Raised when an error doesnâ€™t fall in any of the other categories.\n",
    "- `OSError`: Raised for operating system-related errors like I/O errors.\n",
    "- `EOFError`: Raised when the `input()` function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data.\n",
    "- `KeyboardInterrupt`: Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (usually Control-C or Delete).\n",
    "- `StopIteration`: Raised to indicate that there are no further items produced by the iterator.\n",

    "\n",
    "While specific exception types help with targeted error handling, sometimes catching broader exceptions is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exception Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Exception` class is the base class for most built-in exceptions. Catching `Exception` will catch most exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might cause various exceptions\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / x\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Except Clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Potentially problematic code\n",
    "    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 100 / number\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The else and finally Clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` statement can include optional `else` and `finally` clauses for additional control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### else Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` clause is executed if the `try` block doesn't raise an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    number = int(input(\"Enter a positive number: \"))\n",
    "    if number <= 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"That is not a positive number!\")\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"Good job! {number} is a positive number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### finally Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` clause is always executed before leaving the `try` statement, whether an exception occurred or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"The file was not found.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # This will execute regardless of whether an exception was raised\n",
    "    print(\"Cleanup operations completed.\")\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        f.close()  # This might fail if the file was never opened\n",

    "### Raising Your Own Exceptions\n",
